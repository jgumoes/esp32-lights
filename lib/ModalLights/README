
a library for handling the LED light modes.

## Intended functionality

There are a variety of brightness modes that the lights can have, and a couple of wave modes that decide what happens after the end brightness has been reached. Defaults to constant brightness until a mode is explicitly given.

```c++
// main.cpp
setup(){
  ...
  modalLightsSetup()
  ...
}

main(){
  ...
  updateLights(currentTimestamp_uS);
  ...
  delay(10ms);
}

// SoftwareAlarm.cpp
changeMode(){ // FIXME: what is the actual function?
  ...
  ModalLights::setLightsMode(params); // set the new mode at the correct time
}

// BrightnessDial.cpp   (not a real file. can be replaced with an on/off switch to same effect)
readDial(){
  ...
  ModalLights::updateBrightness(dialVal);
}
```

## requirements
  - the modal parameters need to be updated using a timestamp
  - needs to work for normal PWM and AC PWM (led lights should have a common interface)
  - how the parameters update should be interpolated, either:
    - from previous values to final values (handles manual change in brightness better)
    - from initial values to final values (easier and less taxing on MCU)
  - the curve should be settable (i.e. brightness should be either linear or logarithmic)
  - the update method should either:
    - get called from main every ~10ms  (more calculations overall)
    - return a delay until next required update (more calculation in method)
  - any updates to the LED brightness should update the previous parameters (should the LED class store these changes?)

maybe this library should be a list of interpolation functions that are fed LED class instances, and update the instances as appropriate.
deallocation creates memory holes and leaks, so the mode values should be passed by reference to an indexed mode function.
this library should actually be a part of the lights object. The lights object should exist for the entire runtime of the microcontroller, and 

## required modes:
  - on/off
  - sunrise/sunset
  - chirp (sinusoidal on/off with increasing frequency)
